#Stream Widgets

A suite of StreamLabs widgets I coded for a streamer friend, pro bono.
Later shifted to StreamElements in order to make use of the SE.Pay integration.
Slowly uploading to git as I switch out the licensed artwork.

## How to Use

Note that these aren't stand-alone apps and require the appropriate app to use.

### StreamElements

1. Go to [My overlays](https://streamelements.com/dashboard/overlays).
2. Create/Edit an overlay.
3. Create a new layer by clicking the '+' button.
4. Select 'Custom Widget' (or 'Alert Box' for custom stream alerts).
5. Open the editor in the layer settings (Toggle 'Enable custom CSS' for custom alerts)
6. Paste in the appropriate code. The .json content goes in the 'FIELDS' box and is used to allow the end user more control over the widget to better fit the overlay design or enable certain funtionality.
